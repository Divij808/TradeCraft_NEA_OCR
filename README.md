TradeCraft 

📘 TradeCraft – Setup & Installation Guide

This page explains how to set up and run the TradeCraft project locally.

1️⃣ Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure the following are installed:

-> Python 3.9 or later

-> pip (Python package manager)
-> A code editor such as PyCharm

-> Internet connection 

-> To check if Python is installed, run:

python --version

2️⃣ Downloading the Project

Download the provided TradeCraft ZIP file

Extract the ZIP to a folder on your computer

Open the folder in your code editor

3️⃣ Installing Required Python Packages

Open the folder called install and run install.py

This will install some libraries
These libraries are used for :

Flask → web framework

yfinance → live stock prices

feedparser → news feeds

requests → API requests

4️⃣ Database Setup

The project uses SQLite, which does not require manual installation.

On first run:

The database file (tradecraft.db) is automatically created

Required tables are generated by the application

No additional setup is needed.

5️⃣ Running the Application

In the project root directory, run:

python app.py


If successful, the terminal will display:

Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/


Open a web browser and go to:

http://127.0.0.1:5000

6️⃣ User Accounts & Verification

Users must sign up with an email address

A verification code (OTP) is sent to the email

Only verified accounts can log in

This improves security and robustness.

7️⃣ Live Stock Prices & News

Live prices are fetched using a centralised price service

Stock news is loaded using RSS feeds

If an invalid stock symbol is entered, the system handles it safely without crashing


8️⃣ Troubleshooting

Problem: Module not found
Fix: Re-run pip install commands

Problem: Live price not loading
Fix: Check the internet connection and stock symbol validity

Problem: Page not loading
Fix: Ensure the Flask server is running and the correct URL is used
